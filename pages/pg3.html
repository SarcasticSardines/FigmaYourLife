They even have custom-designed manhole covers all around the city, with illustrations of me and my friends. That means when you think of Shinagawa, hopefully you'll be thinking of me too!</p>

(To give you an idea of how big of a deal this is, this year there were over 44 million votes submitted in total!) I first won in 2017 and 2018, and I've been holding the #1 title since 2020! I'm on a winning streak, but maybe next year one of my friends will get first instead! I don't mind if I don't win, as long as I can make people happy :3</p>
