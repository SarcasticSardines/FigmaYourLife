+ Used figma.com to create the prototype of a website that includes a landing page, interests page, and accomplishments page.
+ Peer reviewed by Sebastian: A cute website that hits all requirements. There is a sizeable about of text but its a good size and color that it isnt a drag to read. There are plenty of images and colors that add character to. Uh. Your character. All buttons work as intended. ~For anyone reading this, did you know that originally this website was supposed to be based off the hit anime character William Afton? Dissapointing it never panned out.
